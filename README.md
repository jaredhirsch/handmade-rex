### artisanal recommendations made by humans:
#### "if you like X, you should hear/see/read/do/explore Y."

Assuming users want to permit non-commercial remixes [BY-NC-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) of their ideas, building infrastructure to make it happen.

### use cases:

#### capturing recommendations people make

1. Write a blog post about a movie. Include hooks to "if you like X, you should see this new movie Y."
    * Aggregate those recs in a separate atom/rss feed
    * Convert those recs into tags, so visitors can sort by X or Y
    * Plug your rec feed into a movie nerd site (silo)
2. Read a great article online, share it with a friend. "You read website X a lot, like my friend Y does, you might also like this article Z."
    * friend gets a webmention with a rec
    * rec syndicates out

#### answering people who want recommendations

1. Question-and-answer style: I like to read books by authors X and Y, but I'm looking for something new. What should I read?
2. Search engine of recs: Go to a recommendation search engine, find a favorite band, get a list of recs of other bands, plus links to reviews in which the recs appeared
3. Map layout style: If you liked hiking over here, check out these similar hikes nearby.

### personal goals in no particular order:

1. Explore [indie web](http://indiewebcamp.com) ideas a bit: microformats, silos without lock-in
2. Build a cool little decentralized social site
3. Liberate humanity from the low S/N ratio oppression of machine-generated recommendation streams
4. Enable cool remixes of human ideas, minus the constraints of lock-in and greed
